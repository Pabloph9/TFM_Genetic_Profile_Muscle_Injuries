# TFM – Genetic performance profile and its relationship with the incidence and severity of musculoskeletal injuries in non-professional football players

This repository contains the R script used for statistical analysis in my TFM, which investigates the association between genetic performance profile and the incidence and severity of muscle injuries in non-professional football players.

## Analysis Included

- Visualization of mean TGS via bar plots
- Basic t-test comparisons
- ROC curve analysis to evaluate predictive capacity of the TGS (Total Genetic Score)
- Binary logistic regression to assess injury risk

> ⚠️ Note: The analysis was run on the variable `FIBRASmusc` (presence/absence of muscle injury), but the code can be adapted to other binary variables.
